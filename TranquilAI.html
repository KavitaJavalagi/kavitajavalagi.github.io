								<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
								<p>In our modern world, technology has changed many things, including how we get help for our mental health. Unfortunately, mental health problems have been looked down upon for a long time, making it hard for people to get the help they need. Fortunately, technology can help improve mental health support. Yet, building an effective and ethical AI-powered chatbot that can accurately address mental health issues is challenging and requires careful consideration of technical, ethical, and clinical aspects.
								</p>
								<h2>Solution</h2>
								<p>The project combines DialogFlow CX and ChatGPT for improved mental health support. DialogFlow CX handles multiple conversations, while ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI API, responds to natural questions with personalized suggestions. Through simple conversations, we aim to make a positive impact on people's well-being.</p>

									<p>The workflow for providing mental health support through a Dialogflow CX chatbot powered by Chat GPT involves three steps: First, the user enters their mental health status into the chatbot. ChatGPT then receives the user's input and generates a response. The response is then sent back to the user via the chatbot. The user can continue to chat in the window until his query is resolved.</p>
							    <p>Although the chatbot can be trained in Dialogflow CX, mental health is a vast area and it is impossible to train the bot to respond to every user scenario. By integrating with a pre-trained and a generative model like ChatGPT, we’re able to make the bot intelligent and capable of handling almost all user queries. Using prompt engineering, we’re also able to customize ChatGPT to respond effectively for user queries in the mental health domain.</p>

								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>The use of chatbots in the mental health industry is on the rise due to their many advantages. While it is important to acknowledge that they are not a substitute for professional help, mental health professionals can still use this technology to work more efficiently. Chatbots can provide support to a large number of users simultaneously, 24/7, and can offer personalized responses to each individual's specific needs. They can also be used as a first point of contact, providing initial assessments and triaging users to the appropriate level of care.</p>
